# ASP2_DZ3 - Algorithms and Data Structures 2: Linear Hashing and Hash Table Implementation

## Description

This project implements a hash table using linear probing for collision resolution. The hash table supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and statistics gathering. The implementation uses a customizable `AddressFunction` interface, with a specific implementation of `LinearHashing` for computing the address during collisions. The hash table automatically resizes when certain conditions are met, optimizing memory usage and search performance.

### Key Features:
- Linear hashing for collision resolution
- Dynamic resizing of the table
- Statistics tracking for successful and unsuccessful search operations
- Interactive menu for performing various hash table operations
- File-based input support for bulk data insertion
